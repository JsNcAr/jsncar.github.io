            <h2>Cronology</h2>
            <p>
                The development of the electromagnetism follow a very interesting historical order we're going to
                follow, so first of all we're going to list the chronological order of some of the key concepts
                that we're going to learn on this course.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coulomb Law -- 1785</li>
                <li>Gauss Law -- 1813</li>
                <li>Biot-Savart -- 1820</li>
                <li>Ampere Force -- 1823</li>
                <li>Faraday's Law -- 1831</li>
                <li>Lenz Law -- 1834</li>
                <li>Ampere-Maxwell law -- 1855</li>
                <li>Maxwell Equations -- 1865</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Now another very important step is to understand in wich part of the physics is located the
                electromagnetism, so here is a graph of the different fields of physics in relation of the velocities
                and magnitude of the phenomena the study.

                Here we can see something curious, the electromagnetism is not located in the graph, and that have an
                elementary explanation; the electromagnetism is a part of every field of physics. From cosmology to
                quantum physics and even Newtonian physics, electromagnetism is a part of every one of those fields.
                That's why electromagnetism is so important and is fundamental to learn it properly. <br> But that just
                sounds like the speech that some electromagnetism professor gives to their students on the first day to
                make them interested in whatever they want to teach, but it's not always something as useful as they may
                say. <br> So, what are some real examples of applications of electromagnetism? Let's begin by analyzing
                how electromagnetism relates to the size and velocity of a system. The electric field is what keeps the
                electrons in the atomic nucleus, and it's the same in the case for any system with a minimal size and
                small speed, it's what link atoms in solids, liquids, and even gases together, and it's also crucial on
                chemical reactions. <br> When we talk about small systems at very high velocities, electromagnetism is
                even more interesting and influential. Because now, not only the electric field is very strong, but also
                the magnetic field is directly related with the velocity of a charged particle, and because most
                subatomic particles are electrically charged, the magnetic field is also very strong. <br> Those
                magnetic fields are crucial on electronics and material physics, which are the base of modern
                technology, and is the
                reason you're able to read this right now. <br> Now, for larger materials at small velocities, while the
                electric and magnetic forces may be weaker than gravitational forces, they are not negligible,
                especially because humans and biological entities are very sensitive to the electromagnetic field. So,
                even relatively low levels of electricity can be very harmful to ecosystems and human beings, especially
                for
                telecommunications and the energy industry, but also for all electric infrastructure from generation
                plants to power outlets in homes. <br> Finally, at the planetary scale, we have a lot of heavy
                electromagnetic influenced objects, including the magnetic field of the planets, quasars, and neutron
                stars, as well as other kinds of magnetic phenomena.
